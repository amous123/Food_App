### Description:
The purpose of this project was to build a mobile app that can detect your current meal, calculate and keep track of the calories. This idea arose from finding a better solution to tracking calories more efficiently and conveniently.

### Demo

#### Process
The application uses the mobile device's camera to analyze the food and determine which it most closely resembles, if it is >80% certain, it classifies it.
Using the current food, it provides an estimated calorie count and tracks it in a user interface.

We used TensorFlow to train a learner to recognize images of fruits. The training dataset consisted of roughly 100 images of each fruit (Apple, Banana, Lemon, Peach, and Orange) as well as the background. The fruit images were downloaded from https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset.
